<h1 id="Dual-0">Duality for linear problems</h1>
<p>
  Let's assume a problem is which we want to minimize the cost:
  $$ \textrm{min}\: c^T x $$
  where \(c^T \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is the cost vector and \(x\in \mathbb{R}^n\) are the unknowns  
  with constraints:
  $$ Ax\geq b \\
     x \geq 0 $$
  where \(A\) has dimension \(m\textrm(x)n\) and \(b\in \mathbb{R}^m\)
  The dual problem is defined as:
  $$ \textrm{max}\: b^Ty $$
with constraints:
$$ A^Ty\leq c \\
     y \geq 0 $$
  where \(y \in \mathbb{R}^m\) are the unknowns of the dual problem.
</p>

<h4 id="Dual-1">Theorem 1</h4>

<p>
For admitted x and admitted y:
$$c^Tx \geq b^Ty $$
because
$$ c^T x \geq (A^T y)^Tx = y^TAx \geq y^Tb$$
</p>
<h4 id="Dual-2">Theorem 2</h4>
<p>
For optimal \(x^*\) and optimal \(y^*\):
$$c^Tx^* = b^Ty^*$$
and if \((Ax^*)_i > b_i\) then \(y^*_i = 0\)
and if  \((A^Ty^*)_i < c_i\) then \(x^*_i = 0\)
</p>

<h3 id="Dual-3">Shadow costs</h3>
Let's suppose that we have a minimization linear problem with constraints as described preciously with an optimal solution \(x^*\) and its corresponding dual problem with optimal solution \(y^*\).

If we modify the i-th constraint:
$$ (Ax)_i \geq b_i + \epsilon_i    $$
the optimal solution becomes:
$$ x^* \rightarrow x^*+\epsilon_i\delta x^*  $$

        <p>I am a Physical Chemist or a Chemical Physicist, according to the situation, 
            the audience, or the mood. My juvenile love was the imaginary states of crystal 
            surfaces and evanescent waves. As I continued my studies, I was amazed by the 
            mathematical beauty of the adiabatic and diabatic descriptions of the molecular wavefunction. 
            Ultrafast moving molecules have filled my nocturn dreams for many years. I finally understood 
            Bloch theorem, six years after having encountered it for the first time. </p>

        <p>Currently, I work as a Data Scientist, in particular in the field of Natural Language Processing.
             Maybe one day I will write something about that on this website. </p>
        
        <p> I love Occam's theorem, the Principles of Thermodynamics (and not only the second one!), 
            elegant concepts and mathematical rigour, playing classical music, singing blues and pop songs, 
            reading (science-fiction, romantic, historical, magic surrealism, surrealist, good) 
            novels, cooking books, scientific essays and comics,  cooking savoury dishes,  cooking sweets 
            for friends, discuss science, literature, politics, and other scurrilous topics, swimming but 
            only in the swimming pool, cycling to the beach, floating on the sea, hiking when it is not midday</p>
        
        <p>I am learning how to make my plants survive. At the moment, I have three orchids, two plants of basils, 
            one immortal bamboo, and some sprouting thyme seeds. </p>
        
        <p>Once, I gave a TedX talk about Memecracy, in a language that I could not speak.</p>
